## Semantic Highlighting

When semantic highlighting is enabled, all symbols are highlighted with different colors based on the syntax.

You can enable / disable semantic highlighting in the VS Code settings. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> to open the command window, and then enter "*Open Settings (UI)*". Search "*semantic*" to find the `Editor>Semantic Highlighting item`. Set the value to `true` to enable semantic highlighting; otherwise set it to `false`.

**Note**: It is suggested that you use **Dark+** color theme of the VS Code. Otherwise, the semantic highlighting colors may be stand out visually.
