## Debugging Binaries Releases

A high-performance debugging feature has been introduced in the 2.2.0 release (and in UniVerse 11.4.1). However, to use this feature, you will need to upgrade UniVerse to version 11.4.1 or higher. If you decide not to upgrade, you can continue using the original debugging feature available on previous versions of the U2 server.

Below is a detailed breakdown of the information for each release.

### 2.2.0 

 - This high-performance debugging feature is supported only on UniVerse version 11.4.1 for both Windows and Linux platforms.
 - If you are using UniVerse 11.4.1, there is no need to manually download and configure these binaries. They are already included in this version.
 - However, please note that this feature and the associated binaries are not supported on any versions previous to UniVerse 11.4.1.
