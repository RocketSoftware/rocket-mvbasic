## Debugging Binaries Release

A high-performance debugging feature has been introduced in Rocket MV BASIC 2.2.0 (and in UniVerse 11.4.1). 

**To use this feature, you need to upgrade UniVerse to version 11.4.1 or later**. If you decide not to upgrade, you can continue using the original debugging feature available on previous versions of the U2 server.

Below is a detailed breakdown of the information for each release. 

 - This high-performance debugging feature is only supported on UniVerse version 11.4.1 for Windows and Linux platforms.
 - If you are using UniVerse 11.4.1 there is no need to manually download and configure these binaries, they are already included in this release.

|  UniVerse  Version |   Windows |   Linux    |    AIX   |
