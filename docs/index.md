## About The Project

Rocket MV BASIC for VS Code is a free Visual Studio Code extension created by Rocket Software. This extension enables BASIC developers to modernize their MultiValue applications in one of the most popular development platforms with an exceptional editing experience.

## Features

This extension offers these features:

 - Highlight BASIC statements and keywords
 - Semantic highlighting
 - Go to / Peek definition of variables and subroutines across files
 - Auto-complete BASIC statements, keywords, and symbols
 - Compile / Debug / Catalog BASIC programs on your U2 server

[and more...](./usage/Features.md)

## Restriction

You can use the extension to edit BASIC program files on the machine VS Code is installed. Direct online editing of BASIC programs on remote multivalue servers it not yet supported.

## Quick Start

Requirements:

1. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) version 1.70.2 or higher
2. [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/20/) version 11 or higher

Using the following steps you can install and start using the Rocket MV Basic extension.

#### Install & configure the extension

1. Open **Visual Studio Code**.

2. Click the **Extensions** icon (<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd>).  

    This opens the **EXTENSIONS** panel.

3. Search for **Rocket MV Basic**

4. Click **Install** and wait for the installation to complete.


If JDK is not part of your PATH you will have to configure the **JDK Environment**. In the **Extensions** panel:

1. Click the **Manage** icon, then **Extension settings**. 

    This opens the **Extension Settings** window.  

2. In the **JDK Environment** section enter the full path to the JDK **bin** folder.

    E.g., *C:\jdk-20\bin*.

#### Open an account folder as a workspace

The source code of your application is stored on the U2 server. To edit it with VS Code you need it accessible on the computer you are using to run VS Code.

One way to do this is to create a file share to your application servers' root folder. This folder usually is the parent folder to the accounts available in the application server. You can then open the accounts available.

1. Click **File** in the Menu bar and select **Open Folder**.

2. Browse to your (network) location and select the account you want to open as a workspace.    

    In this example we browsed to the network location **U:\\**, and selected the MVTUTOR account.

3. Click **Select Folder**.  

    The **Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder?** window opens.

4. Select to **Trust the authors of all files in the parent folder**.
5. Click **Yes, I trust the authors**.

#### Activate the extension

Now that you have opened an account you can enable the extension. This will create two new subfolders: **.rmv** and **.vscode**.

1. Press <kbd>F1</kbd>.  

    This opens the command palette.

2. Type **Activate Rocket MV Basic** and click on the option as it appears.
3. Choose between **UniVerse** and **UniData**.  

    A notification will show **Rocket MV BASIC extension started**.

In the **EXPLORER** you will see two new folders: **.rmv** and **.vscode**. These are created by the extension and contain configuration files.

#### Connect to your server

The VS Code extension can connect to your MultiValue application server. This allows you to compile, debug, and catalog your programs. To connect to your server you need:

* the **server address**.
* your **username**.
* your **password**.
* the **name** of the account you want to open.

To connect:

1. Press <kbd>F1</kbd>.  

    The command palette opens.

2. Type **Connect**, then click **Connect/Disconnect U2 server**.

3. Type the **server address** and confirm with **Enter**.

4. Type your **user name**. If required, you can prefix your user name with your domain such as *MYCOMPANY3\myname*.

5. Type your *password*.

6. Type the **name** of the *account* you want to open. Then confirm with  <kbd>Enter</kbd> 

    This shows the notification **Connection to account MVTUTOR established**.

7. Notice the check box and account name in the status bar, this indicates the connection status.
8. To disconnect press <kbd>F1</kbd>, then click **Connect/Disconnect U2 server**.  

    You will see a notification Disconnected from MV server.

> You can also connect using the **Click to connect** icon in the status bar. This will open the same prompts for server address, user name, password, and account name.

> When connected, you can disconnect by clicking on the account name in the status bar.

#### Create and run `Hello World`!

You are now connected. Let's create a new Hello World program and compile and run it.

1. In the **EXPLORER** expand your program folder. E.g., *MVTUTORBP* or *BP*.

2. Right-click the folder and select **New file...**, then enter the name **HELLO.WORLD** and confirm with <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

3. Type the following statement on the new and empty line 1.  
    `CRT 'HELLO WORLD'`

4. Notice how the **HELLO.WORLD** editor tab now has a circle icon (âš«).  

    This indicates the program has changed and changes are not yet saved to disk.

5. Press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> to save the file.  

    The file is displayed as PLAIN TEXT without syntax highlighting. In rare cases your source code might be recognized as Visual Basic.

6. Click on **Plain Text** in the status bar to open the command palette, then type **Rocket** and click **Rocket MV Basic**.

    This activates the extension for this editor, the program is now displayed with syntax highlighting. At a later stage you will add file associations to automatically enable syntax highlighting.

7. Click **Run** > **Run without debugging** (<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>), then click **MVBasic debug** in the command palette prompt.

    A terminal window opens and the debug menu is displayed.

    Optionally, a **Windows Firewall** window might ask for permission to connect JDK to your application server.

8. Click the **Continue** icon (<kbd>F5</kbd>).

    The terminal will print **HELLO WORLD**.
