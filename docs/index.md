## Getting started

Requirements:

1. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) version 1.75 or higher.
2. [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/20/) version 11 or higher.

### Install & configure the extension

  1. Install this extension from the VS Code Marketplace.

	*Step 1*: Open **Visual Studio Code**.

	*Step 2*: Click the **Extensions** icon ![EXTENSIONS](./img/icon-extensions-20x20.png) (<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd>). This opens the **EXTENSIONS** panel.

	*Step 3*: Search for **Rocket MV Basic**.

	*Step 4*: Click **Install** and wait for the installation to complete.

  2. Download, install and setup the Java environment. Note that you can skip Step 1 and Step 2 if you already have Java 11+ (OpenJDK or Oracle JDK) installed. 

	*Step 1*: Click **Manage** ![Manage](./img/icon-manage-20x20.png) **>** **Extension settings**. This opens the **Extension Settings** window.  

	*Step 2*: In the **JDK Environment** section enter the full path to the JDK **bin** folder. For example., *C:\jdk-20\bin*.

	*Step 3*.  Open User Settings (use the appropriate option listed below):

	**On Windows/Linux**

	- File > Preferences > Settings

	- Use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd> to open the setting editor 

	- Press <kbd>F1</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> to open the Command Palette, and then select `Preferences: Open Settings (UI)`

	**On macOS** 

	- Code > Preferences > Settings

	- Press <kbd>F1</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> on Mac to open Command Palette, and then select `Preferences: Open Settings (UI)`

	*Step 4*. Search “Rocket” to locate the Rocket MV BASIC extension and enter the Java bin path as illustrated in the example below.

	**Note**: Using this method, an existing working environment that requires a different version of Java would not be impacted and the extension will work properly in the Java 11 (or above) environment.

### Open an account folder as a workspace

  1. Select "File" > "Open Folder" to open a folder that contains the BASIC program files you want to view or edit. You can also add multiple folders to the workspace using "File" > "Add Folder to Workspace". We recommend that you open the U2 account level folders to avoid encountering exceptions.

	**Note**: This extension is designed to work with folders/directories rather than individual program files. If you open a single file, some functions may be limited.

  2. Activate the extension.

    - By default, the extension is automatically activated when opening a file with the suffix ".B". If your BASIC program files don’t end with a ".B" suffix, please refer to the FAQ to see how to customize the rules for activating the extension automatically.
    - If the extension is not activated automatically, please open the *Command Palette* in VS code(use any option listed below), and enter the "Activate Rocket MV BASIC" command to activate it manually.  
    
        **On Windows/Linux**
    
        - View > Command Palette
    
        - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>
    
        **On macOS**
    
        - View > Command Palette
    
        - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>
    
    **Note**: Currently, the extension does not provide version control capabilities. Users should manage source code versions independent of this extension.
