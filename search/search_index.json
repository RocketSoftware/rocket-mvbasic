Search \u201cRocket\u201d to locate the Rocket MV BASIC extension and enter the Java bin path as illustrated in the example below. Note : Using this method, an existing working environment that requires a different version of Java would not be impacted and the extension will work properly in the Java 11 (or above) environment. Open an account folder as a workspace Select \"File\" > \"Open Folder\" to open a folder that contains the BASIC program files you want to view or edit. You can also add multiple folders to the workspace using \"File\" > \"Add Folder to Workspace\". We recommend that you open the U2 account level folders to avoid encountering exceptions. Note : This extension is designed to work with folders/directories rather than individual program files. If you open a single file, some functions may be limited. Activate the extension. By default, the extension is automatically activated when opening a file with the suffix \".B\". If your BASIC program files don\u2019t end with a \".B\" suffix, please refer to the FAQ to see how to customize the rules for activating the extension automatically. If the extension is not activated automatically, please open the Command Palette in VS code(use any option listed below), and enter the \"Activate Rocket MV BASIC\" command to activate it manually.

X is the value you set to this setting. By default X is 5 seconds. isSearchAllDirs : specifies whether to search all sub-folders to find catalog programs in the current account folder. By default, the value is false, and only the folder containing the file current being edited is searched. If set to true, all sub-folders will be searched. programDirs : sets the account and folder in which to search for catalog files. You can add multiple items in this setting. fileName : file folder name. account : account folder name. programMapping : catalogName : catalog program name; sometimes this is different from the source code file name. program : catalog program file name, which is the source code file name. account : specifies the account that contains the catalog program file. You can configure multiple account folders in the configuration file. Please refer to Accounts Settings for more details. fileName : file folder name. Examples Example 1 . Search for catalog programs in another source code folder in the current account folder. For example, add a folder named \"OtherFolder\" to search for catalog programs in current account folder: \"programDirs\": [ { \"fileName\": \"OtherFolder\" } ] Example 2 . Search for catalog programs in another account\u2019s folders. For example, add the folder \"OtherFolder\" (from the \u201cDEMO\u201d account) to search for catalog program files: \"programDirs\": [ { \"account\": \"DEMO\", \"fileName\": \"OtherFolder\" } ] Example 3 . Create a mapping relationship between the names of catalog programs and their source files. For example, to map the catalog program named \"CtlgProgram\" to the source code file named \"SourceCode\", the settings should be: \"programMapping\": [ { \"catalogName\": \"CtlgProgram\", \"program\": \"SourceCode\" } ] Example 4 . Create a mapping relationship between the names of catalog programs and their source files, where the source code is in another account folder. For example, to map the catalog program named \"CtlgProgram\" to the source code file named \"SourceCode\" (which exists in the \u201cBP\u201d file folder of the \"DEMO\" account ), the settings should be: \"programMapping\": [ { \"catalogName\": \"CtlgProgram\", \"file\": \"BP\", \"program\": \"SourceCode\" } ] Example 5 . Create a mapping relationship between the names of catalog programs and their source files, where the source code file is in another file folder of the current account. For example, to map the catalog program named \"CtlgProgram\" to the source code file named \"SourceCode\" (which exists in the \u201cBP\u201dfolder), the settings should be: \"programMapping\": [ { \"catalogName\": \"CtlgProgram\", \"account\": \"DEMO\" \"file\": \"BP\", \"program\": \"SourceCode\" } ] Quick Catalog Users can right-click a BASIC program file and select \"Catalog\" to catalog a single file for both Universe and Unidata databases Catalog Settings in \"basic.mvbasic.json\" file Cataloging a program makes it available to all users or to users of one account. You must catalog a program before another BASIC program can call it as an external subroutine. { \"catalog\": \"\", \"arguments\": \"\", \"initialCharacter\": \"\", \"ud_compile_flavor\": \"\" } Cataloging in Universe Local Catalog : Local cataloging creates a VOC entry for the program. This entry is a verb that points to the file and record containing the object code for the cataloged program. You can access a locally cataloged program only from the account in which it was cataloged, unless you copy the VOC entry for the catalog name to another account. Because cataloging a program locally only creates a VOC entry pointing to the object file, you need not recatalog the program every time you recompile it { \"catalog\": \"local\", \"arguments\": \"\", \"initialCharacter\": \"\", \"ud_compile_flavor\": \"\" } Normal Catalog : Normal cataloging copies the specified object record to the system catalog space, making it available to all users. The name of the program in the catalog is in the following format: account catalog.name account is the name of the current account directory. Normal cataloging also creates a VOC entry for the catalog name. This entry is a verb that contains the name account catalog.name in field 2. Because normal cataloging copies the object code to the system catalog space, you must recatalog the program every time you recompile it. To catalog a program normally, specify a catalog.name that does not begin with the characters *, -, $, or !, and do not specify the keyword LOCAL. { \"catalog\": \"normal\", \"arguments\": \"\", \"initialCharacter\": \"\", \"ud_compile_flavor\": \"\" } Global Catalog : Like normal cataloging, global cataloging copies the specified object record to the system catalog space, making it available to all users. The name of the program in the catalog is in the following format: catalog.name -catalog.name $catalog.name !catalog.name Global cataloging does not create a VOC entry for the catalog name. The UniVerse command processor and the run machine look in the system catalog space for verbs or external subroutines with names that have an initial , - , $, or ! character. Because globally cataloged subroutines are accessed without a VOC entry, they are available to all accounts on the system as soon as they are cataloged. Because global cataloging copies the object code to the system catalog space, you must recatalog the program every time you recompile it.

Note : Before you compile BASIC programs, a U2 server must be connected. For information on connecting to a U2 server, see this section . After you compile, regardless of whether the compile succeeds or fails, the BASIC files will be synchronized to the U2 server, overwriting the existing ones and creating new files. Generated objective files will not be synchronized from the server to the local machine. Compilation does not work properly when VS Code and the extension installed on Linux platform. Compile and catalog There are four methods to compile BASIC program files: From editor context Right-click in the file you want to compile then select \"Compile BASIC programs\". If there are no other modified files in your project, the compile process will be started immediately. If other modified files exist, a list of modified files will display. Select files you want to compile, and then click \"OK\". The compilation result will display in the VS Code terminal. Note : Using this method, compiled programs will not be cataloged. For UniData, different flavors are supported. Right-click in the file you want to compile then select \"Compile BASIC programs\". The language value from the basic.mvbasic.json file si read with the value set to: \"ud_compile_flavor\". See this section to set ud_compile_flavor value. From a file explorer Select one or more files, then right-click the file(s) and select \"Compile selected BASIC programs\". The compilation result will display in the VS Code terminal. Note : Using this method, compiled programs will not be cataloged. Through VS Code task By using VS Code tasks, users can compile or catalog multiple BASIC programs at the same time. Create a BASIC build task Select \"Configure Default Build Task ...\" or \"Configure Tasks ...\" from the \"Terminal\" menu to open the Command Palette. Select \"BASIC: build\" to create a BASIC build task. A default build task configuration will be created and displayed in the editor. { \"version\": \"2.0.0\", \"tasks\": [ { \"type\": \"BASIC\", \"targets\": [], \"compile\": { \"dataSource\": \"UNIVERSE\", \"arguments\": \"\" }, \"problemMatcher\": [], \"label\": \"BASIC: Build\", \"group\": { \"kind\": \"build\", \"isDefault\": true } } ] } If the project already has a build task, please see Example 4 (UniVerse) or Example 3 (UniData) for instructions on how to add a new build task. Task properties You can find task properties in the VS Code official documents . There are also some BASIC compilation specified properties: type : must be set to \"BASIC\". This is used to identify that the current task is a BASIC build task. targets : a list that contains the files you want to compile. The value should be the file's relative path. See the examples section for more details. compile : compilation related settings that contains following configurable items: dataSource : Must be \"UNIVERSE\" or \"UNIDATA\", depending on the connected U2 server. catalog : For UniVerse, you can select \"global\", \"local\", or \"normal\". For UniData, you can select \"global\", \"local\", or \"direct\". If not set, files will not be cataloged. initialCharacter : (For UniVerse only) The initial character of the cataloged program can be set only when the catalog parameter is set to \u201cglobal\u201d. arguments : Put additional compilation arguments here. For more details, refer to the UniVerse / UniData user manual. By default, this setting doesn\u2019t appear in the configuration file and must add it manually if needed. Run build task Select \"Run build task\" from the \"Terminal\" menu to start the build task. Note 1 : Ensure that a U2 server has been connected. Otherwise, an error will occur. Note 2 : Once you click on \"Run build task,\" BASIC is complied using the compile flavor value set to ud_compile_flavor in the basic.mvbasic.json file, instead of compiling with the \"language\" value specified in the task (for Unidata). Note 3 : The \"language\" parameter is removed from task.json file. Through Command Palette Users can open the Command Palette and then click on \"Compile selected BASIC programs\". This will compile only the program files that are currently open in tabs. UniVerse Compile Task Examples Example 1 . Compile a single BASIC program without cataloging. { \"version\": \"2.0.0\", \"tasks\": [ { \"type\": \"BASIC\", \"targets\": [ \"BP/SAMPLE_FILE\" ], \"compile\": { \"dataSource\":\"UNIVERSE\" }, \"problemMatcher\": [], \"label\": \"BASIC: Build\", \"group\": { \"kind\": \"build\", \"isDefault\": true } } ] } Add the source code relative path to \"targets\". In this example, SAMPLE_FILE is in the BP folder. \"dataSource\" must be \"UNIVERSE\" for UniVerse. Don't set \"catalog\" and \"initialCharacter\" if you don't catalog programs. Example 2 . Compile multiple BASIC program files and perform global cataloging. { \"version\": \"2.0.0\", \"tasks\": [ { \"type\": \"BASIC\", \"targets\": [ \"BP/SAMPLE_FILE1\", \"BP/SAMPLE_FILE2\", \"BP/SAMOLE_FILE3\" ], \"compile\": { \"dataSource\":\"UNIVERSE\", \"catalog\": \"global\", \"initialCharacter\": \"Asterisk mark (*)\" }, \"problemMatcher\": [], \"label\": \"BASIC: Build\", \"group\": { \"kind\": \"build\", \"isDefault\": true } } ] } You can add multiple source code relative paths to \"targets\". Set \"catalog\" to \"global\" if you want to perform global cataloging. If the \"catalog\" type is global, you need set \"initialCharacter\", or the default value \"Asterisk mark (*)\" will be used.

In this example, SAMPLE_FILE is in the BP folder. \"dataSource\" must be \"UNIDATA\" for UniData. You do not need to set \"catalog\" if you don't want to catalog programs. The \"Language\" parameter is removed so you cannot select it. In this example, It will read the compilation UD flavor value from the basic.mvbasic.json file, with the value set to: \"ud_compile_flavor\". See this section to set ud_compile_flavor value. Example 2 . Compile multiple BASIC program files and perform global cataloging. { \"version\": \"2.0.0\", \"tasks\": [ { \"type\": \"BASIC\", \"targets\": [ \"BP/SAMPLE_FILE1\", \"BP/SAMPLE_FILE2\", \"BP/SAMOLE_FILE3\" ], \"compile\": { \"dataSource\":\"UNIDATA\", \"catalog\": \"global\" }, \"problemMatcher\": [], \"label\": \"BASIC: Build\", \"group\": { \"kind\": \"build\", \"isDefault\": true } } ] } You can add multiple source code relative paths to \"targets\".

A high performance debugging feature A high-performance debugging feature is supported on UniVerse 11.4.1 and UniData 8.3.1. To use this feature, you must upgrade to UniVerse 11.4.1 / UniData 8.3.1 or higher version. Please see Debugging Binaries Releases for more details. Start Debugging Note : You should not debug BASIC subroutines directly, because this not allowed in UniVerse and UniData. Connecting to a U2 server account folder Before using the debugging feature, you must connect to a U2 server account folder firstly. Please see the Connection section for offline mode and Online Editing for online mode to learn how to connect to a U2 server account. Note : The debugging feature will not work if you only open a single BASIC program file in VS Code. You must open an account folder. Debugging BASIC files There are 2 methods to debug a BASIC program file: debugging without a launch file and debugging with a launch file. Before debugging, open the BASIC program first. Note : debugging a BASIC subroutine directly is not allowed. Debugging without a launch file Note : Debugging without a launch file works properly in offline mode only; in online mode, please create launch file. Click the Run and Debug icon on from the left menu bar. The Run and Debug view will display if you have no launch.json file in your project. Click the Run and Debug button to start debugging the currently focused BASIC program file. The BASIC program file will be compiled first. For UniData, there are different compilation flavors and it will read the compile flavor from basic.mvbasic.json, with the value set to: \"ud_compile_flavor\". Please see this section to set ud_compile_flavor value. On successful compilation, the debugging process will stop at the first runnable line of code in the program file. Debug with launch file You have the option to configure the type and task parameters in the launch.json file which helps VS Code know how to run and debug your code. launch.json file helps VSCode know how to run and debug your code. launch.json in MVVS has the type and task parameters, it means that VSCode is first running a task before starting the debugging process. type: The type parameter tells VS Code what type of code you're working with. Valid values are: MVBasic, Python. task: The task parameter is a step that needs to happen before debugging starts, like preparing your code. You have the option to tell VS Code which debugging settings to use in the launch.json file. In the Run and Debug view, click the create a launch.json file link. Select the MVBasic Debug from the Select environment dialog box. A default debugging configuration file named launch.json is generated in directory .vscode and contains the following. { \"version\": \"0.2.0\", \"configurations\": [ { \"type\": \"mvbasic\", \"request\": \"launch\", \"name\": \"Launch Program\", \"program\": \"\", \"stopOnEntry\": true, \"preLaunchTask\": \"BASIC: Build\", \"dependencies\": [], \"arguments\": \"\" } ] } \"type\": \"mvbasic\" is required to build BASIC program files. \"request\": keep this value \"launch\" to launch a program. \"name\": this is the name of the launch task. You can change the name to other values. \"program\": if this value is empty, current focused file will be debugged. You can also set this value to another BASIC program file's absolute path. This file will be compiled before debugging. \"stopOnEntry\": used to control whether the program will be stopped at the first runnable line when start debugging.

Two general strategies exist for concurrency control: pessimistic locking and optimistic locking. The default mode is now Optimistic Locking . In this mode no continuous server lock is held; instead, the extension performs a lock/conflict check when a file is first opened and again each time it is saved. Lightweight validation might also occur during certain edit or focus events. Optionally, a full exclusive and continuous pessimistic locking mode is available and can be enabled per project via the basic.mvbasic.json setting file_lock_state . Concepts Overview Term Description Optimistic phase The period you are editing locally without holding a server lock during which conflicts are assumed to be rare. Optimistic check A verification step performed when you open a file and before a file save, and potentially a per-edit event, to ensure the file is not exclusively locked elsewhere. Pessimistic (exclusive) lock A continuous lock retained for the full edit session to prevent others from opening the file. file_lock_state Configuration flag ( ON / OFF ) in basic.mvbasic.json that enables (ON) continuous exclusive locking or (OFF) keeps default optimistic locking. Configuring Exclusive (Continuous) Locking You can switch between the default optimistic mode and the pessimistic exclusive lock mode. Steps: Open the basic.mvbasic.json file in your online editing project. Add or modify the property: json { \"file_lock_state\": \"ON\" // or \"OFF\" (default optimistic) } Save the configuration file. Reopen the BASIC program file for the setting to take effect. Meaning: ON : Enables pessimistic exclusive locking . When a BASIC file is opened, an exclusive lock is held for the entire edit session. Other users attempting to open the same file receive a message: This file is locked by another user. OFF (default / if omitted): Enables optimistic locking . Multiple users can open the same file. Pessimistic (Exclusive) Locking (file_lock_state = ON) Pessimistic locking assumes conflicts are likely. A lock is acquired when the file is opened and retained for the full editing session until the editor is closed or the file is otherwise released. This prevents others from opening the file. Continuous locks can: Block other developers for long periods. Increase the risk of stale locks if the editor crashes. In this case, the extension attempts cleanup, but external factors can interfere. When File is Already Locked: If another user already has the file open with an exclusive lock, any subsequent user attempting to open the same file will see the following message: Message: This file is locked by another user. The file open operation will be aborted, and the file will not open in the editor. Optimistic Locking (Default, file_lock_state = OFF) In optimistic mode you edit a local copy without holding a server lock. The extension: Acquires a short READ/validation lock/check when opening. Releases it immediately after obtaining a clean copy. Performs a conflict/lock check before saving (and may perform lightweight checks when an edit is made or when regaining focus) to ensure no exclusive lock is currently held elsewhere. Advantages: Minimizes lock contention. Improves scalability with many users. Reduces risk of lingering locks after network issues. Risk: Another user or external process could modify the server copy between your open and save. Your save then overwrites their changes (last-writer-wins) without merge. Currently MVVS does not perform an automatic diff/merge or modification timestamp comparison before overwrite. Save Workflow (Step-by-Step) Optimistic Mode ( file_lock_state = OFF): the user triggers Save in VS Code. The extension performs an optimistic conflict/lock check, and attempts a short WRITE or validation lock. If the acquisition/check fails, a warning displays and the save is aborted. The remote file stays unchanged. If the check succeeds, a local copy is uploaded and the remote content is replaced. Any temporary lock is released immediately. Exclusive Mode ( file_lock_state = ON): The file already has an exclusive lock from open. the user triggers Save and the write proceeds directly while the existing lock guarantees exclusivity. The lock is released when the editor/file is closed or project is unloaded. Best Practices for Teams Use file_lock_state = ON for highly critical or frequently contended programs where overwrites are unacceptable. Use the default optimistic mode for general development to keep collaboration fluid. Communicate when editing critical programs to avoid surprise overwrites (optimistic) or prolonged locks (exclusive). Save frequently in optimistic mode to reduce the conflict window. Consider exporting to version control for complex collaborative changes. File Modified on Server When the same file on the same server is edited by another user, the system will notify you with the following message: Message: The file \"fileName\" in \"dirName\" has been modified by another user on the server. Click Okay to overwrite the file. User Actions & Outcomes: Click Overwrite (Okay): The file will be overwritten on the server, and you will see a confirmation message: File saved successfully Click Cancel: - The overwrite is canceled, and your local changes are kept. Close the File Without Overwriting: - You will be prompted whether to save the file or close it without saving.","title":"File Locking"},{"location":"usage/FileLock/#file-locking-in-online-editing","text":"This section explains how the MVVS Online Editing feature handles file locking when working with BASIC program files on a UniVerse or UniData (U2) server.

This allows you to organize file lists with more concise groupings. You can also customize group content and hide unnecessary files. Configuration In each workspace folder, you can specify source code directories and add customized groups by modifying the configuration file groupView.mvbasic.json . If no customized groups are added, a default rule will be used instead. Note that this default rule can also be changed. If a source code directory is not specified, the current opened folder will be used as the source code directory. Folders will not be displayed in the group view unless they are specified as source directories. Group view related settings are set from the \"groupView\" section of the configuration file. If you make changes to the configuration file, refresh the group view to make the change take effect. Ignore files list You can specify which files to ignore (not be displayed in the group view) from the \"ignore\" section in \"groupView\". Here is a sample configuration: \"ignore\": [ \"VOC\", \"D_*\", \"BP/SAMPLE\" ] The following file specification methods can be used in the \"ignore\" section: File names: for example, \"VOC\", \"D_VOC\". Using the wildcard character: for example, \"D* \" specifies that all files that start with \"D \" in the current directory will be ignored. Using a relative path: for example, if the current opened folder is \"C:\\U2\\UV\\XDEMO\", then \"BP/SAMPLE\" specifies that \"C:\\U2\\UV\\XDEMO\\BP\\SAMPLE\" will not be displayed in the group view. Note that in this example, \"BP\" should be configured as the source code folder. Default auto-group rule If you do not add customized groups in the configuration file, the auto-group view function will use a default rule to organize the files and create groups in current opened folder. Here is the default configuration: \"default\": { \"delimiter\": \".\", \"level\": 2 } delimiter specifies the character(s) to use to separate the file names. For example, if specifying the \".\" delimiter, the file \"SAMPLE.BASIC.PROGRAM\" is separated to 3 parts: \"SAMPLE\", \"BASIC\" and \"PROGRAM\". Both single character and multiple character delimiters are supported in \"delimiter\", but for readability, we recommend using only single character. level specifies how to combine group names based on the separated parts of the file names. For example, there are three files: \"SAMPLE.BASIC.FILE\", \"SAMPLE.BASIC.CODE\" and \"SAMPLE.BASIC.PROGRAM\". These three files all have a uniform file name format in the first two parts of the files: \"SAMPLE.BASIC\". These can be placed into one group. If \"level\" is set to 2, then these will be placed into the group \"SAMPLE.BASIC\". If \"level\" is set to 1, then these will be placed into the group \"SAMPLE\". As you can see, \"level\" specifies that the default group name contains the number of the same parts in file names. If \"level\" is set to an invalid number (for example, -1), then default value of 2 is used instead. Files that do not have similar name formats will not be placed into any groups. Source directories and customized groups In the groups section, you can add source code directories and customize groups. Here is a sample configuration: \"groups\": [ { \"sourceDir\": \"PARENT/BP\" } ] You can add a source code folder by adding an element in groups . Use sourceDir to specify the source code folder name or a relative path. Multiple source code folders can be specified. If no source code folder is specified, or if there is only one source code folder configured, the source code folder name will be omitted. If there are no customized groups in the source code folder, the default rule will be applied. Here is a sample configuration for adding customized groups: \"groups\": [ { \"sourceDir\": \"PARENT/BP\", \"groupName\": \"SAMPLE\", \"include\": [ \"SAMPLE.*\" ], \"exclude\": [ \"SAMPLE.BASIC.CODE\" ] } ] groupName specifies the customized group name. include specifies which files will be included in this group. exclude specifies which files should be excluded from this group. Note that when files are excluded from a group, they can alternatively be placed into other groups. If you need to add multiple groups into one source code folder, add multiple element items in groups . For example: \"groups\": [ { \"sourceDir\": \"PARENT/BP\", \"groupName\": \"SAMPLE\", \"include\": [ \"SAMPLE.*\" ], \"exclude\": [ \"SAMPLE.BASIC.CODE\" ] }, { \"sourceDir\": \"PARENT/BP\", \"groupName\": \"SAMPLE2\", \"include\": [ \"TEST.*\" ] } ] In this example, two customized groups (SAMPLE, SAMPLE2) are added to the source code folder \"PARENT/BP\". Note : one file can only be placed into one group. This means that if you were to specify that a file be included in multiple different groups, it would only be added to the first specified group. Multiple workspace folders support If there are multiple workspace folders, workspace folder names will be displayed in the group view, and group view configuration files for each workspace folders are separated. Please refer to Exmaple 4 for more details. Examples The samples below illustrate how to configure the auto-group view function. Example 1 In this example, the default rule\u2019s delimiter is changed from \".\" to \"_\". The directory structure of the opened folder is: DEMO/ |- SAMPLE_BASIC_FILE_1 |- SAMPLE_BASIC_FILE_2 |- SAMPLE_BASIC_FILE_3 |- SAMPLE_MENU_FILE_1 |- SAMPLE_MENU_FILE_2 |- SAMPLE_FILE |- SAMPLE.CODE The configuration for group view is: \"groupView\": { \"default\": { \"delimiter\": \"_\", \"level\": 2 } } In the auto-group result, files with names that contain \"_\" will be grouped automatically. The result is shown below: SAMPLE_BASIC |- SAMPLE_BASIC_FILE_1 |- SAMPLE_BASIC_FILE_2 |- SAMPLE_BASIC_FILE_3 | SAMPLE_MENU |- SAMPLE_MENU_FILE_1 |- SAMPLE_MENU_FILE_2 | SAMPLE.CODE SAMPLE_FILE Example 2 In this example, a source code directory and a customized group are specified in the settings. The directory structure of the opened folder is: DEMO/ |- BP1/ | |- SAMPLE.BASIC.FILE_1 | |- SAMPLE.BASIC.FILE_2 | |- SAMPLE.CODE.FILE_1 | |- SAMPLE.CODE.FILE_2 | |- BP2/ | |- SAMPLE.BASIC.FILE | |- SAMPLE.FILE Below is the configuration file content: \"groupView\": { \"default\": { \"delimiter\": \".\", \"level\": 2 }, \"groups\": [ { \"sourceDir\": \"BP1\", \"groupName\": \"SAMPLE\", \"include\": [ \"SAMPLE.BASIC.*\" ] } ] } In the auto-group result below, groups will be displayed, but the source code folder \"BP1\" will not. \"SAMPLE\" group is a customized group, and \"SAMPLE.CODE\" is generated based on the default auto-group rule. SAMPLE |- SAMPLE.BASIC.FILE_1 |- SAMPLE.BASIC.FILE_2 | SAMPLE.CODE |- SAMPLE.CODE.FILE_1 |- SAMPLE.CODE.FILE_2 Example 3 In this example, there are multiple source code directories and customized groups. The directory structure of opened folder is: DEMO/ |- BP1/ | |- SAMPLE.BASIC.FILE_1 | |- SAMPLE.BASIC.FILE_2 | |- SAMPLE.CODE.FILE_1 | |- SAMPLE.CODE.FILE_2 | |- BP2/ | |- SAMPLE.CODE.FILE_3 | |- SAMPLE.CODE.FILE_4 | |- SAMPLE.FILE The configuration for group view is: \"groupView\": { \"ignore\": [ ], \"default\": { \"delimiter\": \".\", \"level\": 2 }, \"groups\": [ { \"sourceDir\": \"BP1\", \"groupName\": \"BASIC\", \"include\": [ \"SAMPLE.BASIC.*\" ] }, { \"sourceDir\": \"BP1\", \"groupName\": \"CODE\", \"include\": [ \"SAMPLE.CODE.*\" ] }, { \"sourceDir\": \"BP2\" } ] } In the configuration file, there are different groups which are filled with different elements of the \"groups\" section.

With this feature, users can remotely edit BASIC program files on the U2 server instead of having to retrieve or upload files from a repository. However, you cannot simultaneously utilize this mode alongside the traditional editing mode. Note: VS Code version 1.75 or higher is required to use this feature. Only Windows is supported in this preview version. Start Using Before utilizing this feature, you must create a new empty folder. This folder will be used to hold the project-related files, including cache files and configuration files, that will be created by this extension. Alternatively, you can opt to open an existing folder dedicated to online editing projects. Note: Do not put both the \".rmv\" folder and the \".rmvonline\" folder in the same directory as this causes unexpected issues. Once the folder is set up, initiate the Online Editing functionality by clicking on the Rocket icon located in the left sidebar. There are three scenarios when you click on that icon: If you have already opened a folder that contains a \".rmv\" folder, it indicates that it is an offline project folder. In this case, you will need to open a different folder instead. If you have already opened a folder that contains a \".rmvonline\" folder, it signifies that it is an online editing project folder. You can use this folder for online editing. If you open an empty folder, you can use it for online editing, but you will need to initialize it first. Configure If you open an online editing project folder or have initialized an empty folder, you will be able to view a tree structure in the extension. Using this feature, multiple U2 servers are supported. However, it is important to note that you can connect to only one server at a time. Configure Server There are two methods to access the configuration file: Click the \"Open Config\" button. Right-click on a tree node and select \"Edit Server.\" By accessing the configuration file, you can perform actions such as adding, editing, or deleting U2 server configurations. \"datasource\" : Must be either UNIVERSE or UNIDATA. In the online editing feature, you can only choose one data source. If you change the data source, the extension must be restarted for the change to take effect. \"address\" : Specify the address of the U2 server. \"name\" : Displays a readable name in the tree view. If left empty, the address will be used as the display name. Duplicate names are not supported. \"username\" : The username used for logging into the U2 server. If left empty, you will need to provide it in an input box when connecting to the U2 server. \"password\" : The password used for logging into the U2 server. If left empty, you will need to provide it in an input box when connecting to the U2 server. \"port\" : By default, the port is set to 31438, but you can change this according to your U2 server configuration. \"account\" : The account name used for connecting to the U2 server. If left empty, you will need to provide it in an input box when connecting to the U2 server. Note: Previously, when connecting to a U2 server, the extension used the XDEMO account as the default account for UniVerse, and the demo account for UniData. \"filterPatterns\" (Optional) : Used to specify filter patterns for Accounts, Folders and Files. There are additional methods available to edit the configuration file: Right-click on a tree view node and select \"Add New Server\" to add a new U2 server configuration. Click on the \"Add New Server\" icon to add a new U2 server configuration. Right-click on a tree view node and select \"Delete Server\" to remove the configuration of the server from the list. After making changes to the configuration file, you must refresh the tree view for the modifications to take effect. Connection To establish a connection, you can right-click on a U2 server node in the tree view and select \"Connect\". This will initiate the connection to the selected server. If you wish to disconnect from a U2 server, right-click the corresponding server node in the tree view and select \"Disconnect\". This will terminate the connection to the server. Note: In the online editing feature, the connection icon in the status bar cannot be clicked. This contrasts with the offline mode, where clicking the connection icon allows you to establish or terminate a connection to a server. Filtering You can establish filters to filter out information you do not want MVVS to display. You can configure MVVS to filter out certain filenames to minimize the number of unnecessary files listed. In the Configure Patterns option, enter the account/folder/file name patterns you want to match. Separate each pattern with a comma. Pattern matching characters are: * * = any string * ? = any character Steps to Configure Filter Pattern Access Configuration : * Right-click the server name, account, or folder. * Select the \"Configure Pattern\" option. Enter Filter Pattern : * Add your desired filter pattern to the servers.mvbasic.json file. * Save the changes. Refresh Connection : * If you are already connected to the server, manually refresh it to apply the changes. View Filtered Results : * Expand the specific server or folder to see only the filtered accounts, folders, and files. Search BASIC programs Users can search for BASIC programs within a folder. Users can specify a search pattern or text to find specific files. This feature is designed for quick access to files, eliminating the need to scroll through the VS Code file view. In the Search option, enter the file name pattern you want to match. Pattern matching characters are: * * = any string * ? = any character Steps to Search BASIC programs Access Configuration : * Right-click the folder inside Account. * Select the \"Search\" option. Enter Search Pattern : * Enter the file name or search criteria and click Enter. View Search Results : * Users can view search result in \"SEARCH RESULTS\" view and open files directly from that view. Editing BASIC programs Once connected to a U2 server, you can expand the server node to access and view the BASIC program files stored on that server. When you open a program file for editing, the MVVS extension automatically detects the language based on the file extension: Files with a .py extension are recognized as Python . Files with a .json extension are recognized as JSON . BASIC files , however, are not auto-detected and you must manually set the language mode to Rocket MV BASIC . There are three ways to set the language mode for BASIC files: 1. Configure language association in settings.json You can configure VS Code to recognize BASIC files by associating filepaths or names with the Rocket MV BASIC language. To apply the language mode to all files under the BP folder : ```json \"files.associations\": { \" /BP/ \": \"rocket-mvbasic\" } To apply it to a specific file, such as TESTSUM : ```json \"files.associations\": { \"TESTSUM\": \"rocket-mvbasic\" } Full example configuration: : ```json { \"[rocket-mvbasic]\": { \"editor.codeLens\": false }, \"files.associations\": { \" /BP/ \": \"rocket-mvbasic\", \" /.rmv/config/*.json\": \"jsonc\" }, \"files.exclude\": { \" /.git\": true, \" /.svn\": true, \" /.hg\": true, \" /CVS\": true, \" /.DS_Store\": true, \" /Thumbs.db\": true, \" /.rmv/catalog/ \": true, \" /_ \": false } } 2. Use the Command Palette You can manually change the language mode using the VS Code Command Palette: Press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the Command Palette. Type and select \u201cChange Language Mode\u201d. Choose \u201cRocket MV BASIC\u201d from the list of languages. 3. Use the status bar language selector You can also change the language mode via the status bar. At the bottom-right of VS Code, you'll see the current language mode, for example, Plain Text, JSON. Click on the current language mode. A language selection menu displays. Select Rocket MV BASIC from the list. You can also Add or Delete BASIC files: Note: Due to access permissions, certain files may not be displayed in the tree view. Additionally, it's important to be aware that not all folders displayed in the tree view will necessarily contain BASIC program files. This is not configurable. Synchronization Here is the synchronization process when editing a BASIC program file: When opening a BASIC program in the extension online editing mode, the extension will apply a READU lock on the corresponding file on the server side. If the file is already locked on the server side, this request will fail, and an error message will be displayed. Once the file is opened in VS Code, the lock will be released, and a copy will be saved on the VS Code side. When a user saves changes in the extension online editing mode, the extension will attempt to apply a WRITE lock to the file on the server side. If the application of this lock fails, a warning message will be displayed. After the WRITE lock to the BASIC file on the server side is successfully applied, the extension will overwrite the corresponding file with the local copy of the BASIC program. All changes made on the server side will be overwritten without warning. Compile and catalog Before using the compilation or catalog functions, a U2 database account must already connected. Quick compile Users can right-click a BASIC program file and select \u201c\u201d to compile a single file. For UniData, there are multiple compilation commands for different flavors. Refer to UD Compilation here Quick catalog Users can right-click a BASIC program file and select \"Catalog\" to catalog a single file for both Universe and Unidata databases. Clicking on 'Catalog' will use the parameters from the basic.mvbasic.json file to catalog the file. If you need to change the catalog type, arguments, or initial character, please update the settings in this file. See Catalog Settings in \"basic.mvbasic.json\" file for more information. Compile / Catalog with configuration file The configuration file can help you to compile and catalog multiple files. Select \u201cConfigure Default Build Task\u2026\u201d from the Terminal menu, and then select \u201cBASIC: Build\u201d to create a build task. A default task file will be generated. For more information on this file, see the \u201cCompile\u201d documentation. Debugging in online mode Refer Debugging for debugging steps. Limitation: Most of the LSP (Language Server Protocol) features are supported, but there are some limitations. Features like Go to Definition, Rename, and Find References may not be able to locate references or definitions in other files. Debugging related functions are not supported. Custom documentation features are not supported. Only one instance of VS Code can be run at a time. Do not click on another account's folder before completing the cataloging of the current BASIC program. Doing so may result in cataloging the wrong BASIC program on the U2 server side. The parameter \"arguments\" in the basic.mvbasic.json file is not supported by the catalog feature. By default, the argument is set to FORCE for both the UV and UD databases.","title":"Online Editing"},{"location":"usage/OnlineEditing/#online-editing","text":"Online Editing is an additional method for modifying BASIC program files on the U2 server.

Once the folder is set up, initiate the Online Editing functionality by clicking on the Rocket icon located in the left sidebar. There are three scenarios when you click on that icon: If you have already opened a folder that contains a \".rmv\" folder, it indicates that it is an offline project folder. In this case, you will need to open a different folder instead. If you have already opened a folder that contains a \".rmvonline\" folder, it signifies that it is an online editing project folder.
